This project is used to support Matlab Algorithms running on Edward and Cloud


For Edward part: 
	How to use it:
		1. Transfer all files in this project (except the RCloud directory which is for cloud part) to Edward.
		2. The CobraToolBox is not included, download the CobraToolBox from github and put it under "SourceData" directory. 
		3. Read the detailed description of the files below. and write your own qsub script and input files.
		4. Qsub your script.

		* If you are not doing the BAFBA,BHFBA,DBFBA project. The below detailed descriptiong would give you a vague idea of what program/data is need and where should you put them. Beware that you should write your own taskmaster.py to handle the input files and output them correctly. Remeber to specify "-ef echo" to check your taskmaster.py



The detailed description of the components in Edward part:

1. Matlab.sh
	The qsub script. 
	Just for my testing convenience, the three arguments that needed to provide for intP.py and serial.py are hardcoded in it. 
	But it is easy for users specifying their own configuration. Just be aware that the corresponding environments should be setted first.
	Variable explanantion: 
		InputFile: is the path of the file that contains the tasklist
		OutputDir: is the path of the directory where outputs of the tasks would be stored
		ProjectDir : is the path of the directory where the BHFBA,BAFBA and DBFBA matlab program and essential model data stored. 

2. intP.py
	A python script that responsible for extracting tasks from input file and calling matlab 
	function with appropriate task arguments.

	Arguements : -i <inputfile> -o <output directory> -p <project directory> -ef <external function> -m <mode>
		-i inputfile would specify where the tasks stores. 
			The task format should be:
				<model>-<task function>-<rxnlist>-<targetRxn>-<substrateRxn>-<MaxKOs>[-<imax>]
			Examples are listed below:
				E coli iJR904-BAFBA-all-UMPK-UNK3-5
				E coli iJR904-BHFBA-all-UMPK-UNK3-1-10
				E coli iJR904-DBFBA-all-UMPK-UNK3-5-10
				* Beware that BAFBA do not need the "imax" attribute
				** When the "rxnlist" attribute is "all". Its actual value would be model.rxns. 
					Otherwise its value shoudl be a name of .xls file that contains 
					appropriate rxn list. (The .xls file reading part should be fine but not
					tested yet, because I do not have an right formated .xls file for the
					three functions)	
		-o output directory 
			Specify where to store the result of tasks.
			* The saving part of BAFBA/BHFBA/DBFBA are modified. Previously they store results
			to a "windows" address.
		
		-p project directory
			Specify where the project resources are.

		-ef external function
			Specify which external funciton is used to process the tasks
			Can use echo to test program

		-m Mode
			Three mode supported - bulk and ms
			Mode bulk:
				Each node read the task_list and then decide to do which part of the list according to its own rank.
				Since the tasks are distributed before runtime. It is not suitable for tasks that have a big variance in problem size
			Mode ms:
				Master-Slave architecture, allocate tasks in run time with the cost of one 
				node working as master.
			Mode bulk-r:
				Similar to mode bulk. But the tasklist would be randomly permutated once before distributing them to worker processes.
	
	The intP.py would :
		Extracts tasks from input file and then distributes them
		Call math_task.m for each task to process them.

3. math_task.m
	A matlab function that initialize the CobraToolbox and call the BAFBA/BHFBA/DBFBA with 
	arguments that provided by serial.py
	This matlab function requires essnetial resources located in certain places:
		1. Project directory would be provided by user. (Refered it as $proj_dir)
		2. CobraToolbox directory should locate in 
			$proj_dir/toolboxes/cobratoolbox/cobratoolbox-master/
		3. dataset and BAFBA/BHFBA/DBFBA shoudl locate in 
			$proj_dir/SourceData/Dataset
			$proj_dir/SourceData/BAFBA
			$proj_dir/SourceData/BHFBA
			$proj_dir/SourceData/DBFBA
			* the .xls file that record rxn list should be located in Dataset directory
